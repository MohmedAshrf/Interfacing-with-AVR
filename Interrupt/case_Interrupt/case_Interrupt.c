CTC : Clear Timer 



(Timer/Counter Control Register)TCCR0: first three selector specify the kind of scaling(0-2).
										
(Output Compare Register)OCR0: 

(Timer/Counter Interrupt Flag Register)
The bit TOV0 is set (one) when an overflow occurs in Timer/Counter0. TOV0 is cleared by hardware
when executing the corresponding interrupt handling vector
TIFR: flag is reseted by writing one on it -> TIFR |= (1<<TOV0);
The OCF0 bit is set (one) when a compare match occurs between the Timer/Counter0 and the
data in OCR0 â€“ Output Compare Register0
TIFR: ocf is reseted by writing one on it -> TIFR |= (1<<OCF0);
